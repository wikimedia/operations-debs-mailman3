Poll the NNTP Server For New Messages
=====================================

The ``mailman gate_news`` command is normally run periodically, usually a few
times per hour, by cron to pole the configured NNTP server for new messages to
be posted to lists that are configured to gateway messages from a usenet group.

There are no options other than ``--help``.
