Template: mailman3-core/init_service_failed
Type: error
_Description: The service for mailman3-core failed!
 The mailman3-core service didn't start correctly.
 This is probably because you didn't configure the database
 appropriately. The service won't work until you do so.
 .
 If you actually DID install the db appropriately, please
 report the bug to the maintainers of mailman3-core package.

Template: mailman3-core/choose_db
Type: select
Choices: sqlite, mysql, postgresql
Default: sqlite
_Description: Which database engine do you want to use for mailman3?
 Mailman3 uses a database at runtime. You can chose between sqlite
 (the default), mysql, or postgresql. This configuration software
 can help you setting up the configuration of mailman3 for
 postgresql and mysql. Should you chose sqlite, then mailman3-core
 defaults will be enough for the mailman binary to start.
